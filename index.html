              I have an experience in different jobs and I consider each of them
              a great experience and I remember it with warmth and do not regret
              anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the first year of university, I worked for several weeks in
              housing and communal services, pulling out weeds in the
              flowerbeds. Then I worked at McDonald's for about a year. There I
              learned communication skills and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
              I graduated from the BSUIR, right after that I took a free
              internship, after which I was hired. There I improved my
              communication skills even more, because I was a consultant
              `analyst.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to apply for another internship. And eventually passed
              the internship successfully and I was invited to work at LeverX
              International. It was another small victory for me. My company has
              a great team and we are all on the same page.

              I’ve been in the IT industry since 2019. I’m a Software Engineer
              with a focus on Front-End development of Fiori apps. During this
              time I’ve worked on multiple enterprise projects, where I was
              responsible for different aspects of front-end development,
              including creating applications, bug fixing, unit and integration
              testing. Also I’m familiar with Agile software development
              approach, code-review process and collaborative development with
              Git tools. I possess robust programming and analytical skills. I
              run into problems at work from time to time, but I think every
              solved problem is an incredible experience.

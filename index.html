                I have an experience in different jobs and I consider each of
                them a great experience and I remember it with warmth and do not
                regret anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the first year of university, I worked for several weeks
                in housing and communal services, pulling out weeds in the
                flowerbeds. Then I worked at McDonald's for about a year. There
                I learned communication skills and teamwork.
              </p>
              <p>
                I graduated from the BSUIR, right after that I took a free
                internship, after which I was hired. There I improved my
                communication skills even more, because I was a consultant
                `analyst.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to apply for another internship. And eventually passed
                the internship successfully and I was invited to work at LeverX
                International. It was another small victory for me. My company
                has a great team and we are all on the same page.

                I’ve been in the IT industry since 2019. I’m a Software Engineer
                with a focus on Front-End development of Fiori apps. During this
                time I’ve worked on multiple enterprise projects, where I was
                responsible for different aspects of front-end development,
                including creating applications, bug fixing, unit and
                integration testing. Also I’m familiar with Agile software
                development approach, code-review process and collaborative
                development with Git tools. I possess robust programming and
                analytical skills. I run into problems at work from time to
                time, but I think every solved problem is an incredible
                experience.
